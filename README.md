# daily-planner

- This daily-planner was made possible by jQuery. I was given starter code to edit, to make the planner functional.

# Objectives

- When the user opens the page, the date is displayed at the top.
- Build timeblocks using jQuery for a standard business day
- Have a visual representation of past, present, and future timeblocks.
- The user can enter events into the timeblock text area, and save them to local storage.
- When the user refreshes the page, the saved event persists.

# Challenges

- The main challenge to this homework was where to begin. We ended up getting a study group going after class, and we all helped each other through this. It was a fun assignment, and taught me a lot about jQuery, and it's usage for responsive webpages.
